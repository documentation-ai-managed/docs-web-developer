## Overview

Web Developer provides a robust platform for creating and managing documentation. You organize content into spaces, build page hierarchies, leverage rich markdown support, manage user roles, and follow a streamlined workflow. These core concepts form the foundation for efficient documentation projects.

## Documentation Spaces

Documentation spaces act as containers for your projects. Create a space for each product, team, or initiative. Each space maintains independent settings, themes, and permissions.

You start by creating a space via the dashboard at `https://dashboard.example.com/spaces/new`. Spaces support custom branding, like setting a brand color to `#3B82F6`.

## Page Hierarchies and Organization

Build intuitive navigation with nested pages. Parent pages contain children, forming a tree structure. Use frontmatter for metadata and slugs for clean URLs.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Root Space] --> B[Introduction]
    A --> C[Quickstart]
    B --> D[Core Concepts]
    B --> E[Authentication]
    D --> F[Spaces]
    D --> G[Hierarchies]
    C --> H[Installation]
```

Link pages with relative paths like `/concepts#page-hierarchies`.

## Content Types and Markdown Support

Web Developer supports standard markdown plus MDX for interactive components. Write rich docs with headings, lists, tables, and code blocks.

  <Tab title="Markdown Example" icon="file">
    Use standard syntax for structured content.

    ```markdown
    ## Heading

    - List item
    - Another item

    | Feature | Support |
    |---------|---------|
    | Tables  | Yes    |
    | Images  | Yes    |
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="MDX Components" icon="code">
    Embed components like `<Callout>` for enhanced UX.

    <CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
    ````javascript
    import { Callout } from './components';
    <Callout kind="tip">Pro tip here.</Callout>
    ````
    ````python
    # Render MDX in Python via markdown-it
    import markdown_it
    md = markdown_it()
    html = md.render("**Bold text**")
    ````
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## User Roles and Permissions

Assign roles to control access. Roles include Viewer, Editor, Admin, and Owner.

| Role    | View | Edit | Delete | Manage Users |
|---------|------|------|--------|--------------|
| Viewer  | Yes  | No   | No     | No           |
| Editor  | Yes  | Yes  | No     | No           |
| Admin   | Yes  | Yes  | Yes    | Yes          |
| Owner   | Yes  | Yes  | Yes    | Yes          |

Set permissions at the space or page level. For example, grant Editors write access to `/docs/guides`.
